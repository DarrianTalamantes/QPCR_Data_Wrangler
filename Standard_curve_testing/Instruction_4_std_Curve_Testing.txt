The Idea of this program is to take standard curves from many different primers and calculate their efficincy and r squared values

Step 1: Create a text file that has the length of each amplicon on a new line. These amplicon lengths should match up with the way the plate was loaded.

To Do: Create an R program that reads in the above text file. It should detect the amount of columns. Extract every amplicon length.

The code below is what I used to calculate the amount of copies in the standards before 

Std_means = ddply(std_data, .(Treatment, Primer_Set), summarize, 
                      meanCP = mean(Cp), ngDNA = mean(Concentration)*5) 
Std_means$CopyNumber <- (Std_means$ngDNA * 6.02214076*10^23)/ (Length *650 * 10^9)


Once you have the copy number and the CT values you can plot the two and calculate the linear values of both. 

You can do this by using the lm() function to calculate the line. Next You can take patrs of the model in a manner similar to this model$r
