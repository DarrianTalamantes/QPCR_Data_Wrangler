The Idea of this program is to take standard curves from many different primers and calculate their efficincy and r squared values

We can calculate the r2 values by plotting the logged concentration on the x axis and the ct values on the Y axis.

Step 1: We have to add names of samples to the data. We also need to add concentration of standards to the data.
Step 2: Use an R program to detect the amount of different primers. Seperate these primers and create a linear model of each of them.
Step 3: use a loop to create graphs and a table that list primer name, efficeincy, r2.
