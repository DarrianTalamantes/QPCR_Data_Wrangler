The Idea of this project is to get data straight from the QPCR abs quant analysis and turn it into something usefull to me. 

Step 1: Run program QPCR_Data_Wrangler1.sh It will  ask for your data file pathway. Input it. Hit enter.
Step 2: Program will ask you to input qualatative data into the new three columns that are blank. Recomend to use excel. Save this in a tab or comma delimiated file. File must have same name as it originally had.
Step 3: Run program QPCR_Data_Wrangler2.sh which will create graphs and place them in the output folder
Step 4: Rejoice your high quality R graphs are made!
